# Emotes

RuneLite plugin that adds highlights and labels for emotes.

Shift + right-click an emote in the emotes panel to add/remove highlighting, update colors to your current settings,
or change labels.

Text is overlaid at the bottom of each emote widget in the event that the clue items plugin overlays its text for emote
clues, which should be at the top.

The plugin also supports setting an emote to scroll to after the emotes UI is reset, e.g., when moving to/from
instances. This can also be done by shift-right-clicking and choosing "scroll-on-reset". This can also be changed in 
the plugin settings panel.

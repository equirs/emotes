# Emotes
RuneLite plugin that adds highlights and labels for emotes.

Shift + right-click an emote in the emotes panel to add/remove highlighting, update colors to your current settings, 
or change labels.

Text is overlaid at the bottom of each emote widget in the event that the clue items plugin overlays its text for emote
clues, which should be at the top.
